# AI NPCs that can Control their Actions along with Dialogue

Imagine a game where AI-powered Non-Player Characters (NPCs) can not only respond to your questions but also perform actions based on your requests! 😄 Cohere's Command model generates character responses, including dialogue and actions, using templates that define their talking style, action list, and bio. 💬 Unreal Engine, even though it can't run Python directly, communicates with it through text files, enabling real-time interaction. 🎮 AssemblyAI transcribes player dialogue, while ElevenLabs generates voice dialogue, which is then imported into the game using the Runtime Audio Importer. 🗣️ The MetaHuman SDK brings these characters to life with facial animations. 😮 Actions requested by players are parsed and executed, ranging from animations to item spawns and even AI-generated music creation. 🕹️

The Repository contains the python script and the demo.umap which you can import in a level in unreal to look at the level blueprint and see the logic. 📂 There are a couple of other files as well that can help you understand better. 📚 If you find this repository helpful, consider giving it a star! ⭐
